# Atomic Blog

A React blog application designed to demonstrate refactoring from **prop drilling** to using React's **Context API**.

## Project Purpose

This project is primarily used to learn and practice refactoring prop drilling patterns with the React Context system. The application starts with a traditional prop drilling approach where data and functions are passed down through multiple component levels, and can be refactored to use React Context for cleaner state management.

## Features

- Blog post management (create, search, clear posts)
- Archive functionality
- Dark mode toggle
- Search functionality for posts

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
